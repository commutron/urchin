            <h3>Information</h3>
            <p>PGA<sup>2</sup>CSV is a utility to convert a PGA file back into simple text files.
              The placement locations are converted into a formatted pick and place CSV file. The overall board information 
              and parts list are converted into plain text files.
            </p>
            <p>Input files must be formatted as UTF-8 text files with a `.pga` extension. Reliable results 
              should only be expected with program files optimized for Hitachi GXH Series machines.</p>
            <p>Downloaded output files are formatted as UTF-8 text files with a `.csv` or `.txt` extension.</p>
            <p>Printed output is generated as html for the browser's print utility. After the printer utility 
              is closed the generated content is destroyed.</p>
